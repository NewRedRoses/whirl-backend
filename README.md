# Whirl - Backend 

This repo is all about the backend for my social media project called `Whirl`. This project is designed with RESTful principles in mind. 

If you would like to see it live, please check it out at [https://whirl.social](https://whirl.social). 

Alternatively, if you would like to checkout the frontend repo, you can check that out its [Github repo](https://github.com/NewRedRoses/whirl-frontend)

As of `3/22/2025`, this project is considered inactive with the potential to be further developed soon-ish.
